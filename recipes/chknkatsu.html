        4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch
        thickness
      </li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 cup frying oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season the chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place the
        flour, egg and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes. Coat the
        chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess. Dip them into the egg,
        and then press into the panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place
        chicken in the hot oil, and cook 3 or 4 minutes per side, or until
        golden brown.
