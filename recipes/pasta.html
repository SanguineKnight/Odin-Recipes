      <li>2 pounds tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package angel hair pasta</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
      <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place tomatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water. Bring just to a
        boil. Pour off water, and cover again with cold water. Peel the skin off
        tomatoes and cut into small pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair
        pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm
        to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet or pan, making sure there
        is enough to cover the bottom of the pan, and saut√© garlic until opaque
        but not browned. Stir in tomato paste. Immediately stir in the tomatoes,
        salt, and pepper. Reduce heat, and simmer until pasta is ready, adding
        basil at the end.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain pasta, do not rinse in cold water. Toss with a bit of olive oil,
        then mix into the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat as low as possible. Keep warm, uncovered, for about 10
        minutes when it is ready to serve. Garnish generously with fresh
        Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
    </ol>
